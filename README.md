## 📝 About the Project

The **Calculator-Basic** project is a web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It was created to apply and demonstrate my skills in front-end web development, particularly in structuring HTML, styling with CSS, and scripting with JavaScript.

---

## ✨ Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.
- Clear and intuitive user interface.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: Styling the calculator for a clean and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Implementing the logic for calculator operations and interactivity.

## 📚 Learnings and Experience

Developing this calculator allowed me to:

- Reinforce my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript.
- Practice event handling to capture and respond to user interactions.
- Implement responsive design principles to ensure usability across devices.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by debugging and refining the calculator's functionality.

This project served as a practical application of my coursework in web development and provided a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
